## Breaking .git internal storage

Git stores commits objects under `.git/objects`. Try to break Git graph by changing some objects file names.
To verify the object you can use this simply command:
```shell
git fsck --full
```

Read more on the `fsck` command [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsck).
